==================

Give #Twitter any hashtag you want. It will search Twitter for that hashtag, take some tweets containing the hashtag, take a random hashtag from one of those tweets, and then repeat the cycle, finally choosing another hashtag. Your job is to find a path between the two hashtags as quickly as possible using the same method as the program.
