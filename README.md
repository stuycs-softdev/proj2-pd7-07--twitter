=====================

This idea is subject to change:

You give it a twitter user. It takes one of their most recent tweets, then finds another tweet that shares a tag with it.
Then it finds a tweet that shares a different tag with that one, and so on. This will create a chain of tweets (you 
can specify how long you want the chain to be) that eventually returns a tweet that will likely be unrelated and
hopefully funny.
